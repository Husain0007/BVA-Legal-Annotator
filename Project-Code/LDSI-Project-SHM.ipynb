Because the veteran was granted the \\nfull benefit he sought, his claims for service connection for \\nright knee degenerative joint disease and a bilateral hand \\nrash are no longer on appeal.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. \\n35, 38 (1993).\\n\\nThe issue has been re-characterized to comport to the medical \\nevidence of record.\\n\\n\\nFINDING OF FACT\\n\\nThe preponderance of the medical evidence is against a \\nfinding that the veteran currently has a psychiatric \\ndisability, to include generalized anxiety disorder and \\nintermittent explosive disorder.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\\n\\nA psychiatric disability, to include generalized anxiety \\ndisorder and intermittent explosive disorder, was not \\nincurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A §§ 1101, \\n1110, 1112, 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \\n§§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307 (2007).\\n\\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\\n\\nNotice and Assistance\\n\\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \\napplication, VA must notify the claimant of the information \\nand evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate \\na claim, which information and evidence VA will obtain, and \\nwhich information and evidence the claimant is expected to \\nprovide.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a).  VA must request that the \\nclaimant provide any evidence in the claimant's possession \\nthat pertains to a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159.\\n\\nThe notice requirements apply to all five elements of a \\nservice connection claim: 1) veteran status; 2) existence of \\na disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service \\nand the disability; 4) degree of disability; and 5) effective \\ndate of the disability.  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \\n473 (2006).\\n\\nThe notice must be provided to a claimant before the initial \\nunfavorable adjudication by the RO.  Pelegrini v. Principi, \\n18 Vet. App.112 (2004).\\n\\nThe notice requirements may be satisfied if any errors in the \\ntiming or content of such notice are not prejudicial to the \\nclaimant.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), \\nrev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \\n\\nThe RO provided the appellant pre-adjudication notice by \\nletter dated in June 2004, and post-adjudication notice by \\nletters dated in July 2005, March 2006, and August 2007.  \\n\\nThe notification substantially complied with the specificity \\nrequirements of Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006) \\nidentifying the five elements of a service connection claim; \\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002), identifying \\nthe evidence necessary to substantiate a claim and the \\nrelative duties of VA and the claimant to obtain evidence; \\nand Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), \\nrequesting the claimant to provide evidence in his or her \\npossession that pertains to the claims.  \\nNo new disability rating or effective date for award of \\nbenefits will be assigned as the claim for service connection \\nis denied.  Accordingly, any defect with respect to that \\naspect of the notice requirement is rendered moot.  See \\nBernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993).  \\n\\nVA has obtained service medical records, assisted the veteran \\nin obtaining evidence, and afforded the veteran a psychiatric \\nexamination and opinion as to the existence of the claimed \\ndisability.  All known and available records relevant to the \\nissue on appeal have been obtained and associated with the \\nveteran's claims file; and the veteran has not contended \\notherwise.  \\n\\nVA has substantially complied with the notice and assistance \\nrequirements and the veteran is not prejudiced by a decision \\non the claim at this time.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe veteran seeks service connection for a psychiatric \\ndisability, to include generalized anxiety disorder and \\nintermittent explosive disorder.  He originally claimed \\nservice connection for anger problems and stress.  \\n\\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \\n38 U.S.C.A. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also \\nprovide that service connection may be granted for a \\ndisability diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, \\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \\ndisability is due to disease or injury which was incurred in \\nor aggravated by service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  \\n\\nGenerally, to prevail on a claim of service connection on the \\nmerits, there must be medical evidence of (1) current \\ndisability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease \\nor injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \\nclaimed in- service disease or injury and the present disease \\nor injury.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999).\\n \\nWhen all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for \\ndetermining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in \\nrelative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either \\nevent, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against \\na claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C.A. § \\n5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\\n\\nService medical records (SMRs) indicate that during service \\nthe veteran attended mental health group therapy on nine \\ndifferent occasions between April 1988 and May 1989.  A \\nSeptember 1988 SMR notes that the veteran was seen for an \\nadjustment reaction to divorce, and an assessment of \\nadjustment disorder with depressed mood was given.  A \\nJanuary1990 SMR notes that the veteran's adjustment disorder \\nwas resolving and that he had no suicidal or homicidal \\nideation.\\n\\nVA treatment records dated in July 1999 note that the veteran \\nwas assessed with fatigue secondary to poor sleep secondary \\nto anxiety.  December 2004 VA treatment records note an \\nassessment of intermittent explosive disorder.  January and \\nFebruary 2005 mental health group therapy notes indicate that \\nthe veteran participated in anger management group therapy.  \\nJanuary 2005 VA psychological records indicate that, \\nfollowing testing, the veteran was assessed with rule out \\nintermittent explosive disorder.\\n\\nA VA psychiatric examination was conducted in August 2007.  \\nThe examiner reviewed the veteran's claim file and medical \\nrecords.  The veteran's visits to mental health and \\nparticipation in group therapy during service were noted, as \\nwas his January 2005 VA psychological testing.  A diagnosis \\nof a history of possible intermittent explosive disorder was \\ngiven and the examiner noted that the information the veteran \\ngave during the examination did not show any significant \\nsymptoms or signs warranting a diagnosis on Axis I.  \\n\\nThe Board accepts the veteran's statements regarding his own \\nsubjective mental impressions that he experienced during and \\nafter service, however he is not qualified to diagnosis a \\nparticular disability or disorder.  See Espiritu v. \\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).\\n\\nService connection cannot be granted if there is no present \\ndisability.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, \\n3.306.  That a condition or injury occurred in service is not \\nenough; there must be a current disability resulting from \\nthat condition or injury.  See Rabideau v. Derwinkski, 2 Vet. \\nApp. 141, 144 (1992).  In the absence of proof of a present \\ndisability, there can be no valid claim.  See Brammer v. \\nDerwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).\\n\\nThe negative evidence in this case outweighs the positive.  \\nAlthough the July 1999 and December 2004 VA treatment records \\nnote assessments of anxiety and intermittent explosive \\ndisorder, respectively, the treating clinicians did not \\nprovide a rationale for their diagnoses and did not review \\nthe veteran's claims file.  In contrast, the physician who \\nconducted the August 2007 VA examination reviewed the \\nevidence of record, including the veteran's claim file and \\ncurrent medical records, examined the veteran, and provided a \\ndetailed rationale for his opinion.  \\n\\nThe August 2007 VA examination report is of the greatest \\nprobative value in light of the physician having reviewed the \\nevidence, thoroughly discussed the evidence, and examined the \\nveteran.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet App. 429, 433 (1995) (the \\nopinion of the physician that is based on a review of the \\nentire record is of greater probative value than an opinion \\nbased solely on the veteran's reported history).  Although \\nthe veteran's lay assertions and the VA treatment reports of \\nrecord have been considered, they do not outweigh the August \\n2007 VA examination report, which shows that although the \\nveteran may have previously had a history of intermittent \\nexplosive disorder, he does not have a current psychiatric \\ndisability.  A competent medical expert makes this opinion \\nand the Board is not free to substitute its own judgment for \\nthat of such an expert.  See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.
